# Appartements price prediction in Bordeaux

The objective of this project is to build a Machine Learning Model that permits to predict appartements price in Bordeaux. the First step was to build a Multiple Linear Regression model that fits Bordeaux Appartements data(Price,Number_rooms,Surface...) that were taken from the website https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/. The second step was write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests, Then a Web page was created in order to allow its users to interact easily with the model created. Finally, the model was deployed into production using Amazon Web Services(AWS). Several frameworks and tools were used in this project as described below:  

  1. Data extraction and analysis : Pandas, Python
  2. Data visualisation : Seaborn, Plotly
  3. Creation and evaluation of the Machine Learning Model: Scikit-Learn
  4. Web page : HTML/CSS, JavaScript
  5. Writing visually clear code(IDE) : Jupyter Notebook, Pycharm, Visual Studio
